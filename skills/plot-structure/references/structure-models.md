## Choosing a Structure

- **Three-Act:** Default choice for most stories. Simple, flexible, well-understood.
- **Hero's Journey:** Fantasy, adventure, coming-of-age. Stories about transformation.
- **Save the Cat:** Tightly paced commercial fiction. Stories that need precise pacing.
- **Kishotenketsu:** Literary fiction, slice-of-life, stories exploring ideas over conflict.
- **Five-Act:** Epic scope, multiple climaxes, complex political drama.

Structures are guides, not rules. Mix and adapt as the story demands.
