# Writing Guidelines

Guidelines for writing chapter prose. Adapt to the story's genre, tone, and POV as defined in `story.md`.

## Show, Don't Tell

- Convey emotion through action, dialogue, and sensory detail rather than stating feelings
- BAD: "She was angry."
- GOOD: "Her fingers whitened around the hilt. She spoke through her teeth."

## POV Consistency

- **First person:** Everything filtered through narrator's voice, knowledge, and bias
- **Third-person limited:** Stay in one character's head per scene. Only describe what they perceive, think, and feel
- **Third-person omniscient:** Can reveal any character's thoughts, but maintain a consistent narrative voice

Do NOT shift POV mid-scene. If a POV shift is needed, use a scene break (marked with `---`).

## Dialogue

- Dialogue should reveal character, advance plot, or both
- Each character should have a distinct voice (reference their Voice & Speech Patterns)
- Use dialogue tags sparingly - "said" is invisible, fancy tags distract
- Break up long speeches with action beats
- Avoid exposition dumps disguised as conversation

## Pacing

- Short sentences and paragraphs = fast pace, tension, action
- Longer sentences and paragraphs = slower pace, reflection, atmosphere
- Vary sentence length for rhythm
- Scene length should match importance - don't over-write minor moments

## Scene Structure

Each scene should have:
- **Goal:** What the POV character wants in this scene
- **Conflict:** What opposes them
- **Outcome:** What happens (often a setback that drives the next scene)

Not every scene needs explosive conflict - quiet character moments matter too. But every scene should change something.

## Sensory Detail

Ground scenes in the physical world:
- Sight, sound, smell, touch, taste
- Choose 2-3 senses per scene, not all five
- Use details specific to the location (reference the location file)
- Sensory details should reflect the POV character's state of mind

## Chapter Openings

- Orient the reader quickly: who, where, when
- Hook with tension, mystery, or voice
- Avoid opening with weather or waking up (unless deliberately subverting the cliche)

## Chapter Endings

- End on a moment of change, revelation, or tension
- Cliffhangers work for action chapters
- Quiet resonance works for character chapters
- The last line should make the reader want to continue

## Continuity

Before writing, check:
- Previous chapter's ending (pick up threads, don't contradict)
- Character states (injuries, emotional state, knowledge)
- Timeline consistency (time of day, travel times, seasons)
- Plot arc progress (what beats need to land)
